    # Base prompt
    prompt = f"""
Create a realistic Linux troubleshooting scenario for a {difficulty} difficulty level in the {category} category.

The scenario should include:
1. A title that briefly describes the issue
2. A detailed description of the problem from the user's perspective
3. A setup script that creates the issue in a Docker container
4. A verification script that checks if the issue has been resolved
5. A list of hints that gradually guide the user to the solution
6. The solution that resolves the issue

The setup script should create a realistic issue that a system administrator might encounter.
The verification script should check if the issue has been resolved and exit with code 0 if successful.

IMPORTANT: Do not use systemd services or any scripts that configure systemd units in your scenarios, as Docker containers typically do not use systemd. Instead, use traditional service management methods like direct process management, init scripts, or supervisor alternatives that are compatible with containers.

IMPORTANT FOR BACKGROUND PROCESSES: When creating scenarios that involve background processes, ensure they are started in a way that persists throughout the container's lifetime. Use techniques such as:
1. Use 'nohup' with output redirection to /dev/null and append '&' at the end
2. Create a simple init script in /etc/init.d/ and ensure it's called at container startup
3. Write the process to a file in /tmp/ or create a PID file to track it
4. Add a check in the setup script to verify the process is actually running before completing

For example:
```
# Start a background process that will persist
nohup /path/to/process > /dev/null 2>&1 &
echo $! > /tmp/process.pid  # Save the PID for later verification

# Verify the process is running before completing setup
sleep 2
if ! ps -p $(cat /tmp/process.pid) > /dev/null; then
  echo "Failed to start background process"
  exit 1
fi
```
